POINTERS:
	int val;//variable
	int *ptr;//pointer
	int **pptr;//pointer to pointer;
	pptr = &ptr;//pptr is address of pointer ptr
	ptr=&val// &val = address of variable val
	printf("%d",*ptr);// *ptr = value at address ptr
	printf("%d",**pptr);//**pptr = value at address on which ptr is pointing (double indirection)
INDIRECTION:
	-Pointer is a varible that refers to an address in your computer's memory and that is called indirection
DOUBLE INDIRECTION:
	-Pointer to a pointer to something
POINTERS AND STRINGS:
	char *ptr = "test";//This is not too logical to me, but it is 100% legit
	printf("%s",ptr);//Not logical too, but it will print "test"
**Examples in this 2 lines above are the main reason for confusion when it comes to pointers and strings combinations. 
		From here you can understand array of pointers(array of strings).
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS:
	-argc = number of string arguments
	-**argv = pointer to pointer to char (array of strings)
	-usage ./[NAME_OF_PROGRAM] [string1] [string2] ...
GENERIC POINTER:
	- void ptr;
	-We can "give" to it address of any data type but we can not increment/decrement it, or show the value at that address, for that
		we need to cast it to that data type, for example: 
		printf("%d",*(int *)ptr);//printing int value on memory location ptr(void pointer casted to int pointer)
ALLOCATING MEMORY:
	-malloc([byte_size]);//returns void*; this just allocates memory and leave's junk data in it
	-calloc([n],[element_size]);//returns void*, n = number of elements; this initialize memory with 0's
	-realloc([ptr],[new_size]);//change the size of already allocated memory
	-free([ptr]);//frees the allocated memory with malloc or calloc
	*This is dynamicly allocated memory on HEAP which is part of the RAM memory.
	-sizeof([anything]);// returns int which represents the size in bytes
NULL POINTER:
	-Pointer with the value NULL is considered to be one that does not point to a valid address:
