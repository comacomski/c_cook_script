POINTERS:
	-Pointer is a varible that refers to an address in your computer's memory and that is called indirection
DOUBLE INDIRECTION:
	-Pointer to a pointer to something
POINTERS AND STRINGS:
	char *ptr = "test";//This is not too logical to me, but it is 100% legit, so,
	printf("%s",ptr);//Not logical too, but it will print "test"
**Examples in this 2 lines above are the main reason for confusion when it comes to pointers and strings combinations. 
		from here you can understand array of pointers(array of strings).
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS:
	-argc = number of string arguments
	-**argv = pointer to pointer to char (array of strings)
	-usage ./[NAME_OF_PROGRAM] [string1] [string2] ...
GENERIC POINTER:
	- void ptr;
	-We can "give" to it address of any data type but we can not increment/decrement it, or show the value on that address, for that
		we need to cast it to that data type, for example: 
		printf("%d",*(int *)ptr);//casting to int pointer
