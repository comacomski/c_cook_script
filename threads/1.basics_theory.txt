1.What is a Thread - Basics:

- A Thread is a basic unit of execution flow
- A process has at least one thread -> main thread
- A Thread runs in the context of a process
- A Thread can create other Threads, other Threads can create more Threads
- A point where new thread is created is called Fork point
- Parent Thread, Child Thread
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-compile on Ubuntu using:
 * gcc -o hello_threads hello_threads.c -lpthread
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Racing Condition = After the Fork point, we can not know which thread will start execution first, it depends on the processor. So, when writing 
program as Developer, you can not assume any fixed order of execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Thread Termination =  Thread fn returns
			pthread_exit(0)
			Thread Cancellation(some other thread cancels the thread)
- If main Thread dies, all other thread dies by default, vice-versa is not true.
